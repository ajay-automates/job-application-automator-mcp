With 4 years of full-stack development experience and a Master's in Software Engineering from Northeastern University, I bring strong expertise in Java, Spring Boot, React.js, and cloud technologies.

My experience at FolderWave involved optimizing backend systems by 30% and improving API response times by 50% - skills directly applicable to auction mechanism optimization. I have hands-on experience with experiment design, data analysis, and system performance optimization, which aligns perfectly with this role's requirements.

I'm particularly drawn to Google's mission of organizing the world's information and would love to contribute to the Ads platform that powers the open internet. My background in both research and practical software development makes me well-suited for this hybrid role.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the opportunity to join Google's innovative team and contribute to auction mechanism improvements."""
